# Alert Definitions for PCF KPIs
This is an attempt to define an alert for all of the KPIs defined in the pivotal documentation. Note that not all KPIs are currently implemented. If you implement
one of the KPIs, please issue a PR.

The KPIs being implemented are documented here:
https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/monitoring/kpi.html

Specify as an operation file when deploying using the bosh2 manifest.
